<h1>Predicting Home Prices from Realty Descriptions</h1>

<p>My wife and I recently bought a lovely house in Sunnyvale,
CA. The overall process went very smoothly (thanks to our realtor
<a href="http://www.dreamsbytheyard.com">Patrick Johnson</a>) which gave
me some spare time to do a little data mining on the property
market in Silicon Valley. There are so many interesting
applications for analytics in the real estate domain that I will
probably write another couple of articles on the subject, but for
now I'll focus on a fun data visualization derived from
text-mining home descriptions.</p>

<p>I will also add that I had the pleasure of meeting some of the
team at <a href="http://www.trulia.com">Trulia.com</a> earlier
this year and they are the ones to watch when it comes to
real-estate analytics. They've got great people, huge amounts of
data and a robust business model. It will be exciting to see what
they bring to market over the next year.</p>

<p>So, back to the data mining. If you have ever read an MLS
listing describing a house for sale you will be familiar with
language like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Classic streamlined California home w/ abundant built-ins, rich hardwood
flooring &amp; tall picture windows to the exterior gardens. Large
Living Room w/ built in shelving &amp; fireplace. Updated Kitchen
w/ granite &amp; stainless steel. Formal Dining w/ sliding door to
dining deck &amp; grounds. Fresh air sunroom w/ doors to pool and
gardens. Fourishing grounds w/ level lawns. Close to Stanford,
dining and shopping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That certainly sounds attractive...it almost makes me want to
pay over the asking price! In fact, that is exactly what I wanted
to explore: does the language used in the home description have any
statistical relationship with whether or not the home sells for
above or below asking price?</p>

<p>The graphic below lets us explore this question in detail. It
was produced by text mining the descriptions of 1300 homes that
sold in Silicon Valley in 2011 and then computing the average sale
price (as a percentage above or below the initial asking price) of
each home containing that word. So for example, homes with the
word "entertaining" in their description sold for well above their
asking price (about 2.8% on average). Words such as "stunning" (-1.2%) and
"bonus" (-1.6%) did not fare so well; you may want to underbid on houses
with those terms in their description!</p>

<p>Here's how I created the visualization:</p>

<ol>

<li>Download a CSV file from Redfin.com containing data on 1300
homes that sold in Menlo Park, Palo Alto or Mountain View in 2011
with a sale price between $600k and $2M.</li>

<li>The CSV file contains a URL for each house; the URL links to a
web page with its MLS description along with its initial and final
selling price. Unfortunately you can only see this page if you are
logged in to your Redfin account. That means you can't just use
Python's urrllib module to webscrape the MLS text; you need to use
some cookie handling code to let Python access the Redfin
website. The script 1_compile_data.py below shows how this
works. I exported my cookie file for use in the Python script
using the
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/export-cookies/">Export
Cookies</a> add-on for Firefox.</li>

<li>The output of 1_compile_data.py is a new CSV file containing
cleaned data on each house, along with the text of its realty
description. This is then parsed with the script
2_create_visualization.py that uses Matplotlib to create a PNG of the
visualization. The script also creates the HTML divs that act
as triggers for the tooltips over each word.</li>

</ol>

<p>And here are the two Python scripts discussed above.</p>

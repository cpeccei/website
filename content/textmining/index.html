<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This package contains a variety of useful functions for text mining in Python. It focuses on statistical text mining (i.e. the bag-of-words model) and makes it very easy to create a term-document matrix from a collection of documents. This matrix can then be read into a statistical package (R, MATLAB, etc.) for further analysis. The package also provides some useful utilities for finding collocations (i.e. significant two-word phrases), computing the edit distance between words, and chunking long documents up into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>The package has a large amount of curated data (stopwords, common names, an English dictionary with parts of speech and word frequencies) which allows the user to extract fairly sophisticated features from a document.</p>
<p>This package does NOT have any natural language processing capabilities such as part-of-speech tagging. Please see the Python NLTK for that sort of functionality (plus much, much more).</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/textmining/1.0">latest version (1.0)</a> is available from the Python Package Index.</p>
<p>To install, either run <code>pip install textmining</code> or download and extract the .zip file and run <code>python setup.py install</code>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>The most common use of the textmining package is to create a term-document matrix for analysis with a statistical package such as R or MATLAB. Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import textmining

def termdocumentmatrix_example():
    # Create some very short sample documents
    doc1 = &#39;John and Bob are brothers.&#39;
    doc2 = &#39;John went to the store. The store was closed.&#39;
    doc3 = &#39;Bob went to the store too.&#39;
    # Initialize class to create term-document matrix
    tdm = textmining.TermDocumentMatrix()
    # Add the documents
    tdm.add_doc(doc1)
    tdm.add_doc(doc2)
    tdm.add_doc(doc3)
    # Write out the matrix to a csv file. Note that setting cutoff=1 means
    # that words which appear in 1 or more documents will be included in
    # the output (i.e. every word will appear in the output). The default
    # for cutoff is 2, since we usually aren&#39;t interested in words which
    # appear in a single document. For this example we want to see all
    # words however, hence cutoff=1.
    tdm.write_csv(&#39;matrix.csv&#39;, cutoff=1)
    # Instead of writing out the matrix you can also access its rows directly.
    # Let&#39;s print them to the screen.
    for row in tdm.rows(cutoff=1):
        print row</code></pre>
<p>In addition to writing the term-document matrix to a CSV file, this code also prints the rows of the matrix to the screen:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>[&#39;and&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;brothers&#39;, &#39;to&#39;, &#39;are&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;, &#39;bob&#39;, &#39;john&#39;, &#39;was&#39;, &#39;went&#39;, &#39;store&#39;, &#39;too&#39;]
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]</code></pre>
<p>Please see the ‘examples’ directory in the package file for other sample applications.</p>
